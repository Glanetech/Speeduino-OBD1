Printed with ASA on a qidi max printer, i would highly suggest using ASA, Nylon or PETG bare minimum. (ASA highly suggested if going to be used outside)

Uses the OBD1-SS pnp adapter from wtmtronix  https://wtmtronics.com/product/honda-ss-obd1/ and fits the throughhole version of the speeduino board.

Has provisions for 12mm (1/2'') hole on the left and right sides for additional wiring.
